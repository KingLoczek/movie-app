    curiosities: "The series is set in 1977, but in many scenes you can hear songs that were released later in the background. In the first episode, the car radio plays Hold the Line by the band Toto, which was released only a year later. The same is the case with the songs Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty (released in 1978) and I Don't Like Mondays by The Boomtown Rats (released in 1979)."
