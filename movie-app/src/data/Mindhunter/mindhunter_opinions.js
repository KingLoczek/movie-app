I've read some people think it gets slow at times but that's only because they're building the story and characters but it absolutely pays off. This series is so well done, from the acting to the directing to the writing to the etc, etc! Everything about this show is great!",

It was not without reason that I wrote a show, not a series, because I think that a production written by Joe Penhall with sensitivity can boldly compete with the best films that deal with this subject.',
