    curiosities: "Baker Street, the original location of Arthur Conan Doyle's books, is said to now have too much Sherlock-related signage to be used as a filming location for the show. The BBC actually shot exteriors 1 mile east of there, at 187 North Gower Street. (NB: The blue plaque next door is for Giuseppe Mazzini, utterly unrelated)."

    curiosities: "Interior shots were filmed in the BBC studio in Cardiff. There are 17 steps between the hall and front room on that very Cardiff set. Why? Because in Conan Doyle's A Scandal in Bohemia we find out that's exactly how many steps lead up to their quarters at 221b Baker Street."

    curiosities: "China's ban on the show hasn't stopped it becoming a huge hit on the internet, in the country. Despite not appearing on the Chinese Central Television network or other major channels, 69 million viewers have still seen it on video websites. Initially makers didn't expect it to be quite the hit it has been in the UK, either. Steven Moffat thought it would bring in somewhere in the region of 4 million viewers. It's average is more than double that."

    curiosities: "Benedict Cumberbatch's parents play Sherlock Holmesâ€™s parents. Wanda Ventham and Timothy Carlton (real name Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch) appeared in the first episode of series three, having tea at Sherlock's flat."
