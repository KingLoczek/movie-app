    description: "Sherlock Holmes is the world's only consulting detective, a profession he created for himself. He has a keen and strong interest in unusual or bizarre crimes, without which he rapidly becomes bored, relying on nicotine to keep his brain active, although in the past he has dabbled in illegal drugs such as heroin for entertainment. Sherlock is a thinker and an observer; his incredible ability to notice and draw deductions from seemingly trivial details is his primary tool for solving crimes he investigates. Sherlock claims on more than one occasion to be a high-functioning sociopath."
