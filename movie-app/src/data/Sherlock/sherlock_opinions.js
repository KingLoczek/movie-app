    opinion: "It is the first show on my list that I would recommend everyone to watch. It’s pace is a little quick and you might have to watch it a few times before you actually, completely understand the plot and everything else. All the cases are very intriguing and one completely falls in love with the character of Sherlock, played amazingly by Benedict Cumberbatch. Sherlock’s inability to understand little things, emotions and his witty humour with his cute hairstyle and coat makes him all the more adorable. But his powers of deduction and the way he solves cases is incredible and a “never seen before experience.” It is suitable for everyone above 8 years of age!"

    opinion: "I've watched the whole series a couple of times now, and I've gotten my friends into the series too now. It's a really good series. If you decide to watch the series and become a part of the Sherlock fandom it'll be totally worth it. I always find something new on Pinterest and Tumblr. It never gets boring."

    opinion: "To my surprise they absolutely nailed it. Cumberbatch is a fantastic choice for Sherlock Holmes-he is physically right (he fits the traditional reading of the character) and he is a damn good actor. Martin Freeman, about whom I wasn't sure at first, is an excellent foil for Holmes without being the dumb sidekick that Dr Watson has often been. I thought that this series would not work, particularly after Robert Downey's interesting take on Conan Doyle's characterisation. I have been proved so wrong-it moved along at a good pace and held the attention brilliantly. My wife started by saying she didn't like it but by the end of the episode she was as enthralled as I. We are both looking forward to the rest of the series, if it is as entertaining as the first story. I was disappointed to read some reviews here that did not love it. Methinks they are too jaded to enjoy anything."
